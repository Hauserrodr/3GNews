Ok, now that we searched for every news, let's generate a dictionary to append to our data in our python script. Answer in this format:
{
    'news_found':, #True | False <- depends on wheter you found any news.
    'news_text':, #Text in portuguese containing every news found.
    'news_sources':, #Every news links visited that had any news used in the news_text.
}
